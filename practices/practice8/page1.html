				One lion can consume up to 88 pounds in one meal.  Each adult lion requires 11 pounds of meat per day.  Unlike many other Felids, they are able to capture larger prey, because they hunt in groups.  Even with that advantage, the lion's hunt success is still only successful in one out of every five attempts, so they scavenge as much as they can.  What they eat includes: warthogs, antelope, buffalo, zebras, gazelles and even small elephants and rhinos.  In one year, one lion consumes the equivalent of 30 medium sized prey animals or 10-20 large prey animals.
