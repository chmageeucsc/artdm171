				<h2>Nutrition: Meal Plan</h2>

        <p>Apr 25, 2024 — John Deer</p>
        <h3><strong>"Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel."</strong></h3>
			</div>
			<div>
				<p>
          Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.
          <br><br>
          Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.
          <br><br>
          Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.
        </p>
				<h4>Nutrition Guide</h4>
				<p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
          <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
          <li>Fruit</li>
          <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.
          <br><br>
          When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.
          <br><br>
          Check out our Meal of the Week for new meal ideas.

        <h4>Meal of the Week</h4>
        <p>Herb Roasted Chicken</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
        </ul>
